# MatchThreeGame-Code
 My code from NotAnotherMatchThreeGame
 
 Game : https://iamdrw.itch.io/notanothermatchthreegame
 
 If you want to know how to not write code, my code should be a great example of what not to do. I made this match three game for fun and defintely not because I failed all my interviews. Hopefully, this could be of use for someone. 
 
 I don't know if the matching thing is done in the most efficient way. I didn't want to look it up and wanted to figure out myself, and so far it seems to work. I didn't notice anything really bad when profiling it. 
 
 The only thing that makes this run kind of slow is the post-processing and maybe the unnecessary 3D background. Not sure how to fix that unless I give the option to disable it, but I ain't aboot to do dat! 1t looks 2 purtty.
 
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
 Have fun.
